This is a multi-week assignment.

1)  Solve a stochastic weight knapsack using whatever method you want.  Each item has two weights.  The agent must consider each item in order from 1--N, and can not return to it after deciding whether to add it.  If added, a coin is flipped to decide whether the item uses up weight1 or weight2 worth of weight.  If the item would take up more weight than available in the worst case, the item cannot be added.

2) Solve blackjack using dynamic programming

3) Solve blackjack using Sarsa

4) Solve blackjack using rllib and PPO.
